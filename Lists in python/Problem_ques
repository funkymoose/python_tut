Basics:
1. Python program for :
    a)Sum of elements in a list
    b)Mul of elements in a list
    c)Largest and smallest element in a list
    d)To check if list is empty or not
    e)To clone or copy a list
    f)To concatenate 2 lists
    g)To return a list of multiplication of each number of list1 with each number of list 2
      given that len of both lists is same.
    h) To access the index of a list
    i) Unpacking a list(splitting objects using variables)
2. Python program to remove duplicates from a list
3. Program to print a list of words whose length is greater than n
4. Write a program to count the number of strings
   where the string length is 2 or more and
   the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
5. Write a function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.
6. Write a program to find common items from two lists.
7. Write a program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple
    from a given list of non-empty tuples.
    Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
    Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]
    a) Find the min element
    b) Find the max element
8. Write a program to count the number of same elements in a list and return a list of tuples
   where tuple must be(value, count)
9. Write a program to count the number of elements in a list within a specified range.
10. Write a program to convert a list of multiple integers into a single largest integer possible.
    Sample list: [11, 50, 33]
    Expected Output: 503311
11. Write a Python program to find missing and additional values in two lists.
12. Write a Python program to find the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
    Sample lists: [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]
    Expected Output: [10, 11, 12]
